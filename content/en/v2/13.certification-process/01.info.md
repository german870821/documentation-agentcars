AgentCars Webservice - Certification Process
========================================

Services Implementation
---------------------
![Process of certification](https://cdn.agentcars.com/images/common/certification-process-en.png)  

Response times

Proper use of services (sending requests, not duplication in calls, or more calls than they should). 
Validating errors example: (invalid dates, invalid rates).

The required services that must have been implemented to start the certification process are:

| Service          | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| getMatrix        | It is responsible for returning all types of cars, grouped by categories, in ascending order according to rate value, within each category   |
| getSelection     | Send the information of the selected car, with the valid rates                                                                               |
| rateInformation  | Bring the details of the selected rate, this is called with the information contained in getSelection, which is dependent on this service    |
| confirmation     | Generates sales, returns the confirmation number of the rental company, with the reservation information                                     |
| cancel           | Cancel Reservation                                                                                                                           |

Values to take into account in the implementation
------------------------

| VARIABLE         | IMPORTANCE    | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| baseAprox        | `Informative` | Indicates the approximate value of the commissionable value, this is used to determine what the client should be charged   |
| taxAprox         | `Informative` | Indicates the approximate value that the customer must pay at the counter                                                  |
| totalAprox       | `Informative` | Indicates the approximate value of the total rent                                                                          |
| rateConverted    | `Informative` | It is the gross rate converted to USD, this is used to order the rates, when they come in multiple currencies, but it is not taken into account |
| rateAmount       | `High`        | getMatrix, amount to be displayed in the car comparison matrix                                                             |
| amount           | `High`        | getSelection, amount to show on page 3, total fee                                                                          |
| base             | `Very high`   |rateInformation, amount to be charged to the customer                                                                       |
| realBase         | `Very high`   |rateInformation, this is the commissionable base, the value on which they commission (some fields also arrive with the commission information)   |
| total            | `High`        |rateInformation, is the actual total value of the reservation, it must match totalAprox, rateAmount, amount                 |
| tax              | `Very high`   |rateInformation, these are the taxes that the customer must pay at the counter                                              |
| realTax          | `Very high`   |rateInformation, these are the taxes that the rate really has, and they are not commissionable, some rental companies like SIXT authorized us to collect taxes, but these are not commissionable, that's why the difference with tax |
| vocuherAmount    | `Very high`   |This is the field that must be shown in the voucher that is generated for the client, along with the currency that appears in the confirmation response.  |

Checklist and Tests for the Certification Process
------------------------

To successfully complete the certification process, the following tests must be performed.
For each one, it is necessary to send a folder that contains:

1. **LOGS:** Complete logs of each service used (requests and responses) in text format (not images).
2. **SCREENSHOTS:**
   - Of the results page (get-matrix service).
   - Of the detail page once a vehicle is selected (get-selection and get-rate-information services).
3. **VOUCHER:** Generated in PDF format corresponding to the reservation made (my-reservation service).

#### Required search scenarios for testing

1. MIA - MIA, provider Hertz
2. FLL - FLL, provider Budget
3. MIA - LAX, provider Alamo
4. MCO - MCO, provider Sixt
5. CDG - CDG, provider Avis
6. MAD - MAD, provider Europcar
7. Miami Beach (search in city, not airport), any provider (Thrifty, Avis, etc.)

**IMPORTANT:** Pay special attention to the fields highlighted in the documentation section
"Values to Consider in the Implementation."

**TEST EXAMPLE:** A complete example of the MIA - MIA test with Hertz is attached, comparing the results with the Agentcars portal: [MIA-MIA-Hertz.zip](https://cdn.agentcars.com/images/common/MIA-MIA-Hertz.zip)

Real Reservations 
------------------------
In this step, we proceed to activate the webservice user, so that he can do real reservations, checking that the confirmations on the part of the rental company are executed correctly.
Additional validations of errors returned by the car rental company directly, that you must be control.
All reservations at this point must have `lastName = Test`, so that the system detects them and automatically cancels them if it is not done, for your part.

Vouchers y Confirmations
--------------------------------------

All reservations must have a  process. E-mail sent to the customer with the notification of the reservation and the PDF document indicating the reservation he have. 
This document is a Voucher for prepaid reservations (ppd) or a confirmation for reservations with payment on destination (pod).
The voucher has special information depending on the car rental company, which will be returned by the `confirmation` service and must be implemented in this.
The confirmation usually has standard information that does not require personalization.
Both should show rate, inclusion and amounts
