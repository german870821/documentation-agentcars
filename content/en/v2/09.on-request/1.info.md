When reservations are confirmed with the `"On Request"` status, it is crucial to perform periodic queries (every hour) to the ["my-reservation"](/v2/my-reservation/request) service over the next 24 hours and monitor the `"status"` field.

If the reservation is canceled, the "status" field will change to `"Cancelled"`, in which case the agency must proceed to cancel it in their own system.

If, on the other hand, the reservation is activated, the "status" field will change to `"Active"`, and the agency should activate it in their corresponding system.
