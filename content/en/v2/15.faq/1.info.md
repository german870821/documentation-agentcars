Below are the most common questions regarding the implementation of the Agentcars API and the certification process:

### 1. Does the `best` rate refer to the cheapest or the recommended option?
The `best` rate refers to the **lowest available price** for the selected destination, not necessarily the recommended one.

---

### 2. Besides the `best` rate, what other rate types are available per destination?
The API includes a service called `rates` which, based on the user's origin and destination, returns a list of available rate types for that search.

---

### 3. I’ve seen the `period type` as both `Before pick-up date` and `After create date`. Are there any other values?
Currently, those are the **only two options** available for `period type`.

---

### 4. Which fields should be used to show the customer what to pay now and what to pay at the counter?
This information comes from the **[get-rate-information](/v2/rate-information/request)** service. Use:

- `base`: amount to be charged to the customer now.
- `tax`: amount to be paid by the customer at the rental counter.

---

### 5. What is the validity period of the `uniqid`?
The `uniqid` is valid for **15 minutes**. After that time, you must call `get-selection` again to generate a new one.

---

### 6. Can I get prices in a different currency?
Yes. Prices are returned in the currency provided by the rental company. However, you can request additional fields with the `converted_` prefix by informing us of your desired currency.

---

### 7. What fields are used for commission calculation?
You should use the following fields:

- `realBase`: the commissionable base amount.
- `realTax`: the non-commissionable tax amount.

This is further explained in the section **[Values to take into account in the implementation](/v2/certification-process/info#values-to-take-into-account-in-the-implementation)**.

---

### 8. What does the `voucherNumber` field represent?
It is the number displayed as **"Voucher Number"** on pre-paid (`PPD`) reservations.

---

### 9. How long do I have to confirm an `OnHold` reservation?
Reservations marked as `OnHold` must be confirmed at least **48 hours before the pick-up time**, otherwise they will be automatically cancelled by the system.

---

### 10. What information must be shown in the voucher?
All data returned in the `voucherInformation` node from the `my-reservation` service must be fully displayed. No field should be omitted.
